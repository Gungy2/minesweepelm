# minesweepelm
Welcome to a cool, little minesweeper game created in Elm by George Ungureanu Vranceanu. Usual rules apply:
 * Left click to reveal the square (first try is guaranteed to be safe)
 * Right click to mark it as a bomb (put a little flag over it
 * Left and right click at the same time to uncover all the neighbours (provided you put down the required number of flags)
